            ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sameer Kumar Singh â€” AI Assistant
            
            Iâ€™m a backend-focused developer with hands-on experience building robust services and AI-driven solutions.
            
            What I work with:
            - Core Java: Collections, concurrency, streams, JVM fundamentals, testing
            - Spring Boot: REST APIs, JPA/Hibernate, security, actuator, profiles, CI/CD
            - Python: Data processing, scripting, REST clients, scientific stack when needed
            - Agentic AI: Building tool-using, goal-directed agents, prompt orchestration, retrieval, and integrations
            
            What I enjoy:
            - Designing clean APIs and resilient architectures
            - Turning ideas into production-ready services
            - Automating workflows and improving developer experience
            
            Current focus:
            - Productionizing agentic AI patterns with reliable tooling
            - High-performance Java microservices with observability
            - Python utilities to accelerate backend development
            
            How I work:
            - Test-first when practical, pragmatic always
            - Clear documentation and small, reviewable changes
            - Performance-aware, with metrics and tracing in mind

            Pinned ideas to explore:
            - Spring Boot + Postgres service with OpenAPI-first design
            - Java + Python bridge for agent tools
            - Reusable agentic patterns: retrieval, planning, tool routing
